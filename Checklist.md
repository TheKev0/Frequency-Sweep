# Checklist

- [ ] Vetting
  - [x] Get commands for spectrum analyzer.
  - [x] Get commands for function generator.
- [x] Install NI GPIB adapter drivers for spectrum analyzer.
- [x] Verify that I can control the spectrum analyzer.
- [x] Verify that I can control the signal generator.
- [ ] Control function generator to output desired signal (constant sine wave of given freq.)
- [ ] Control spectrum analyzer to set current BW, enable peak detect, and read out the peak.
